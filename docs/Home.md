## Installation

**Requirements**

The server requirements are basically the same as for [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/about/requirements/) with the addition of a few ones :

- PHP >= 8.2
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)

**Installation**

You can use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/). Follow the [installation instructions](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md) if you do not already have composer installed.

```bash
composer require dbout/wp-orm
```

In your PHP script, make sure you include the autoloader:

```php
require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';
```

ðŸŽ‰ You have nothing more to do, you can use the library now! Not even need to configure database accesses because it's the `wpdb` connection that is used.
